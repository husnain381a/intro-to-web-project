## Project Overview
Open Skills Source is a platform designed to provide free resources, curated courses, and personalized recommendations to learners. Our mission is to offer accessible learning tools that empower individuals to enhance their skills and achieve their goals. The platform features a user-friendly interface, where users can explore resources, discover learning paths, and access valuable educational content, all tailored to their interests.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structured the website with semantic markup to ensure accessibility and responsiveness.
- **CSS**: Styled the website to create a clean, modern, and visually appealing user experience, ensuring mobile responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity and dynamic features, including the AI-powered recommendation system and interactive course listings.

## Features
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Powered by an AI bot that suggests learning content based on user interests.
- **Comprehensive Course Library**: Free access to a wide range of courses across various domains.
- **All-in-One Resource Hub**: Guides, career path suggestions, interview tips, and other learning resources.
- **Learn Anytime, Anywhere**: Responsive design for easy access across devices, allowing learning on the go.

## Current Stage
This repository contains the client-side code of the website, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend, including APIs and databases, will be added in future versions to allow for user authentication, dynamic content, and enhanced personalization.

## Collaboration
We are proud received collab offer from ASR LEARNING INSTITUTE.

## Future Enhancements
